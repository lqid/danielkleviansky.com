Software engineer and systems architect, based in Australia. I've spent the better part of a decade building large-scale platforms for the federal government. The kind where downtime isn't really an option and "we'll fix it later" is a career-limiting phrase. Voice biometrics, AI contact centres, Kubernetes infrastructure, workforce automation. Important, invisible, occasionally stressful.

I also make music. An album and several singles, electronic and ambient, self-produced. Available on all the streaming platforms that will pay you approximately nothing.

On the side, I'm building *Hold Tight*, an indie game on Unreal Engine 5 with a small team. Progress is steady. Spirits are high. We have a Slack.

When I leave the house: bouldering, skateboarding, and flying small aircraft. I hold a private pilot licence, which is one of the more useful pieces of paper I own.
