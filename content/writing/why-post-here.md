Call it my own personal silent revolution. A refusal, in some small way, to partake in the mass social media onslaught that comes at us relentlessly each day. I'd be lying if I said that I didn't want to leave something behind, some kind of legacy, some kind of proof that I was here. And while this _is_ partly that, it's also me practicing what I preach: to not be afraid of being bad at things. I'm not a writer, nor has anyone ever accused me of being one, but I'm learning, practicing, doing. I am partaking in _this_ process.
