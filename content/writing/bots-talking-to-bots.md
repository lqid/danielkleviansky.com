Every ounce of my being has been wanting to vent about this for far too long, and I think it's reached a boiling point. I want you to know that every piece of this, has been written by me. The fact that I have to point that out is the problem. It's truly awful out there, with AI creating a lack-of-creativity hellscape. Everyone is rushing to just create more. They feel that if they don't create more, they're being "left behind", but what are you actually contributing to? What is your end goal here, other than to just "take up space"? What value are you bringing to the table? And I don't just mean monetary value, I'm speaking specifically about real world, holistic, human value.

My LinkedIn is swamped with people I know and deeply respect, but if you think that I can't tell that your posts are written by AI, you're delusional. Sorry, not sorry. I may love you as a human being, but someone needs to tell you the truth. I know what you sound like, and it sure as hell is not that. Wake up. Surely you've noticed that everyone sounds/writes the same? Nobody freaking talks like this, so how can you expect anyone to relate to what you're saying, other than other people just farming for exposure and/or engagement?! So at this stage, we have bots, talking to bots, talking to bots.

No, I don't want to listen to your AI music, or look at your AI art. Stop sending it to me. Yes, mine was written by me, performed by me, and my cover artwork was created by real artists, to whom I personally commissioned, worked with, paid. Do you truly believe that I'm interested in your computer lyrics? What are you expecting my reaction to be, when you say to me "I toiled so hard over this!". Get real, my bro.

I want to be clear, that there is nothing wrong with code being written by AI, in fact, it has indeed saved me a bunch of time. This is not a rally against a specific tool or industry, rather it's a call to sanity. Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. Well done to all of those who have discovered a new tool (no matter if you should use that tool or not), but just as I own a drill set, that doesn't make me an expert carpenter, or a dentist. The barrier to entry is lower on a lot of things, and I'm sure the breadth and depth of that will continue to expand, but that doesn't mean we should be lowering our standards.

Call me a hot head millennial who is feeling insecure about their place in the world. Show me one that isn't, I dare you.
